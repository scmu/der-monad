\begin{abstract}
Equational reasoning is one of the most important tools of functional
programming. 
To facilitate its application to monadic programs, Gibbons and Hinze have
proposed a simple axiomatic approach using laws that characterise the
computational effects without exposing their implementation details.  At the
same time Plotkin and Pretnar have proposed algebraic effects and handlers, a
mechanism of layered abstract by which effects can be implemented in terms of
other effects.

This paper performs a case study that connects these two strands of research.
We consider two ways in which the nondeterminism and state effects can
interact: the highlevel semantics where every nondeterministic branch has a
local copy of the state, and the lowlevel semantics where a single sequentially threaded  state is
global to all branches. 

We give a monadic account of the folklore technique of handling local state in
terms of global state, provide a novel axiomatic characterisation of global
state and prove that the handler satisfies Gibbons and Hinze's local state
axioms by means of a novel combination of free monads and contextual
equivalence. We also provide a model for global state that is necessarily
non-monadic.
