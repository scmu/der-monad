\section{Motivation}
\label{sec:motivation}
In the previous section we discussed two possible semantics for the interaction
of state and nondeterminism: global and local state semantics.
In this section, we will further explore the differences between these two
interpretations.
Using the classic $n$-queens puzzle as an example, we show that sometimes we
end up in a situation where we want to write our program according to local
state semantics (which is generally speaking easier to reason about), but desire
the performance characteristics of global state semantics.

The $n$-queens puzzle presented in this section is adapted and simplified from that of Gibbons and Hinze~\cite{GibbonsHinze:11:Just}.
The aim of the puzzle is to place |n| queens on a |n| by |n| chess board such that no two queens can attack each other. Given |n|, we number the rows and columns by |[0..n-1]|. Since all queens should be placed on distinct rows and distinct columns, a potential solution can be represented by a permutation |xs| of the list |[0..n-1]|, such that |xs !! i = j| denotes that the queen on the $i$th column is placed on the $j$th row (see Figure \ref{fig:queens-examples}(a)). In this representation queens cannot be put on the same row or column, and the problem is reduced to filtering, among permutations of |[0..n-1]|, those placements in which no two queens are put on the same diagonal. The specification can be written as a non-deterministic program:
\begin{code}
queens :: MNondet m => Int -> m [Int]
queens n = perm [0..n-1] >>= filt safe {-"~~."-}
\end{code}
where |perm| non-deterministically computes a permutation of its input, and the pure function |safe :: [Int] -> Bool| determines whether no queens are on the same diagonal. The monadic function |filt p x| returns |x| if |p x| holds, and fails otherwise. It is defined in terms of standard monadic function |guard|:
\begin{code}
filt :: MNondet m => (a -> Bool) -> a -> m a
filt p x = guard (p x) >> return x {-"~~,"-}

guard :: MNondet m => Bool -> m ()
guard b = if b then return () else mzero {-"~~."-}
\end{code}
This specification of |queens| generates all the permutations, before checking them one by one, in two separate phases. We wish to fuse the two phases and produce a faster implementation.

\paragraph{Permutation}
The monadic function |perm| can be written both as a fold or an unfold.
For this problem we choose the latter.
The function |select| non-deterministically splits a list into a pair containing one chosen element and the rest:
\begin{code}
select :: MNondet m => [a] -> m (a,[a]) {-"~~."-}
select []      =  mzero
select (x:xs)  =  return (x,xs) `mplus` ((id *** (x:)) <$> select xs) {-"~~."-}
\end{code}
where |(f *** g) (x,y) = (f x, g y)|.
For example, |select [1,2,3]| yields one of |(1,[2,3])|, |(2,[1,3])| and |(3,[1,2])|. With its help, |perm| can be defined by:
\begin{code}
perm :: MNondet m => [a] -> m [a]
perm []  = return []
perm xs  = select xs >>= \(x,ys) -> (x:) <$> perm ys {-"~~."-}
\end{code}

\paragraph{Safety Check} Representing a placement as a permutation allows an easy way to check whether two queens are put on the same diagonal.
An 8 by 8 chess board has 15 {\em up diagonals} (those running between bottom-left and top-right). Let them be indexed by |[0..14]| (see Figure \ref{fig:queens-examples}(b)).
If we apply |zipWith (+) [0..]| to a permutation, we get the indices of the up-diagonals where the chess pieces are placed.
Similarly, there are 15 {\em down diagonals} (those running between top-left and bottom right).
By applying |zipWith (-) [0..]| to a permutation, we get the indices of their down-diagonals (indexed by |[-7..7]|. See Figure \ref{fig:queens-examples}(c)).
A placement is safe if the diagonals contain no duplicates.
Simple functional program calculation shows that we can merge zipping and duplication-checking into one traversal. That is, we may define
|safe xs = safeAcc (0,[],[]) xs|, where
\begin{spec}
safeAcc (i,us,ds) []      = True
safeAcc (i,us,ds) (x:xs)  = ok (i',us',ds') && safeAcc (i',us',ds') xs {-"~~,"-}
  where  (i',us',ds') = (i+1, (i+x : us), (i-x : ds))
         ok (i,(x:us), (y:ds)) = x `notelem` us && y `notelem` ds {-"~~."-}
\end{spec}
The function |safeAcc| is essentially a fold-left followed by a reduce.
Operationally, |(i,us,ds)| is a ``state'' kept by |safeAcc|, where |i| is the current column we are looking at, while |us| and |ds| are respectively the up and down diagonals encountered so far.

The function |safeAcc| uses non-determinism but not the state effect.
One naturally wonders whether the ``state'' can be implemented using an actual state monad. Indeed, the following function |filtAcc|, which returns an arrangement if it is safe, works by saving |(i,us,ds)| in a local state:
\begin{spec}
filtAcc :: MStateNondet St m => St -> [Int] -> m [Int]
filtAcc (i,us,ds) xs = put (i,us,ds) >> foldr odot (return []) xs {-"~~,"-}
where  x `odot` m =  get >>= \(i,us,ds) ->
                     let (i',us',ds') = (i+1, (i+x : us), (i-x : ds))
                     in  guard (ok (i',us',ds')) >>
                         put (i',us',ds') >> ((x:) <$> m) {-"~~,"-}
\end{spec}
where |St = (Int, [Int], [Int])|.
One would expect to have |filt (safeAcc st) = filtAcc st|.
However, since the LHS does not alter the state while the RHS does, what we actually have is:
\begin{equation}
  |filt (safeAcc st) xs| ~=~ |protect (filtAcc st xs) {-"~~,"-}|
    \label{eq:filtSafeAcc}
\end{equation}
where |protect m = get >>= \ini -> m >>= \x -> put ini >> return x|
saves the initial state and restores it after the computation.
By converting |filt . safeAcc st| into |filtAcc|, we have turned a fold-left into a |foldr|.

To prove \eqref{eq:filtSafeAcc}, we need the non-determinism laws, the state laws, \emph{and} \eqref{eq:mzero-bind-zero} and \eqref{eq:mplus-bind-dist}. These allows us to freely move |guard| around, a crucial property we need for the proof.

\paragraph{Fusing the Phases} Now that the safety check can be performed in a |foldr|, recalling that |perm| is an unfold, it is natural trying to fuse them into one.
Indeed, it can be proved that, with |odot| defined above, we have |perm xs >>= foldr odot (return []) = qBody xs|, where
\begin{spec}
qBody :: MStateNondet (Int, [Int], [Int]) m => [Int] -> m [Int]
qBody []  =  return []
qBody xs  =  select xs >>= \(x,ys) ->
             get >>= \(i,us,ds) ->
             let (i',us',ds') = (1 + i, (i+x):us, (i-x):ds)
             in  guard (ok (i',us',ds')) >>
                 put (i',us',ds') >> ((x:) <$> qBody ys) {-"~~,"-}
  where  ok (_,u:us,d:ds) = (u `notElem` us) && (d `notElem` ds) {-"~~."-}
\end{spec}
The proof again heavily relies on the property that non-determinism and state commutes --- when the state is local.

To wrap up, having fused |perm| and safety checking into one phase, we may compute |queens| by:
\begin{spec}
queens :: MStateNondet (Int, [Int], [Int]) m => Int -> m [Int]
queens n = protect (put (0,[],[]) >> qBody [0..n-1]) {-"~~."-}
\end{spec}
\todo{improve the explanation}

\subsection{Space Usage of Local State Implementations}
For a monad with both non-determinism and state, the local state laws imply that
each non-deterministic branch has its own state. This is not costly for states
consisting of linked data structures, for example the state
|(Int, [Int], [Int])| \koen{double check this state type after the example
  subsection has been rewritten}
in the |n|-queens problem. In some applications, however, the state
might be represented by data structures, e.g. arrays, that are costly to
duplicate.
Especially when each new state is only slightly different from the previous
(say, the array is updated in one place each time), we have a wasteful
duplication of information.

Global state semantics, on the other hand, has a more ``low-level'' feel to it.
Because only a single state is threaded through the entire computation without
making any implicit copies, it is easier to reason about resource usage in this
setting. So we might write our programs directly in the global state style.
However, if we do this to a program that would be more naturally expressed in
the local state style (such as our $n$-queens example), this will come at a
great loss of clarity. Furthermore, as we shall see, although it is easier to
reason about resource usage of programs in the global state setting, it is
significantly more difficult to reason about their semantics. We could also
write our program first in a local state style and then translate it to global
state style. Doing this manually is a tedious and error-prone process that
leaves us with code that is hard to maintain. A more attractive proposition is
to design a systematic program transformation that takes a program written for
local state semantics as input, and outputs a program that, when interpreted
under global state semantics, behaves exactly the same as the original program
interpreted under local state semantics.

In the remainder of the paper we define this program transformation and prove it
correct. \koen{should we stress here that the core contribution is not the
  program transformation but the proof/proof technique?}
