\section{Non-Determinism with Global State}
\label{sec:nd-state-global}

\koen{TODO duplication in bg section}
Finding a correct characterisation of a nondeterministic monad with global state
is rather tricky.
One might believe that |M a = s -> ([a],s)| is a natural implementation of such a monad.
The usual, naive implementation of |(>>=)| using this representation, however, does not satisfy left-distributivity \eqref{eq:bind-mplus-dist}, violates monad laws, and is therefore not even a monad.
%See Section \ref{sec:conclusion} for previous work on construction of a correct monad.
\footnote{
The type |ListT (State s)| generated using the now standard Monad Transformer Library~\cite{MTL:14} expands to essentially the same implementation, and is flawed in the same way.
More careful implementations of |ListT|, which does satisfy \eqref{eq:bind-mplus-dist} and the monad laws, have been proposed~\cite{Gale:07:ListT,Volkov:14:list-t}.
Effect handlers (e.g. Wu~\cite{Wu:14:Effect} and Kiselyov and Ishii~\cite{KiselyovIshii:15:Freer}) do produce correct implementations if we run the handler for non-determinism before that of state.
}

\koen{the following needs some rewriting (our commutativity story isn't entirely
  correct)}
Even after we do have a non-deterministic, global-state passing implementation that is a monad, its semantics can sometimes be surprising.
In |m1 `mplus` m2|, the computation |m2| receives the state computed by |m1|.
Thus |mplus| is still associative, but certainly cannot be commutative.

As mentioned in Section~\ref{sec:combining-effects}, right-distributivity \eqref{eq:mplus-bind-dist} implies commutativity of |mplus|.
Contravariantly, \eqref{eq:mplus-bind-dist} cannot be true when the state is global.
Right-zero \eqref{eq:mzero-bind-zero} does not hold either: |mzero| simply fails, while |put s >> mzero|, for example, fails with an altered global state.
These significantly limit the properties we may have.

The aim of this section is to appeal to intuition and see what happens when we work with a global state monad:
what pitfalls we may encounter, and what programming pattern we may use,
to motivate the more formal treatment in Section~\ref{sec:ctxt-trans}.

\subsection{The Global State Law}
\label{sec:laws-global-state}

We have already discussed general laws for nondeterministic monads
(laws~\eqref{eq:mplus-assoc} through~\eqref{eq:bind-mzero-zero}),
as well as laws which govern the interaction between state and nondeterminism in
a local state setting (laws~\eqref{eq:mplus-bind-dist} and
\eqref{eq:mzero-bind-zero}).
For global state semantics, an alternative law is required to govern the
interactions between nondeterminism and state.
We call this the \emph{global state law}, to be discussed in more detail in Section~\ref{sec:model-global-state-sem}.
\begin{alignat}{2}
&\mbox{\bf put-or}:\quad&
  |(put s >> m) `mplus` n| &=~ |put s >> (m `mplus` n)|~ \mbox{~~,}
    \label{eq:put-or}
\end{alignat}
This law allows the lifting of a |put| operation from the left
branch of a nondeterministic choice, an operation which does not preserve
meaning under local-state semantics:
suppose for example that |m = mzero|, then by
\eqref{eq:mzero-bind-zero} and~\eqref{eq:mzero-mplus}, the left-hand side of
the equation is equal to |n|, whereas by
~\eqref{eq:mzero-mplus},
the right-hand side of the equation is equal to |put s >> n|.

By itself, this law leaves us free to choose from a large space of semantic domain
implementations with different properties.
For example, in any given implementation, the programs |return x `mplus` return y| and
|return y `mplus` return x| may be considered semantically identical, or they may be
considered semantically distinct.
The same goes for the programs |return x `mplus` return x| and |return x|,
or the programs |(put s >> return x) `mplus` m| and
|(put s >> return x) `mplus` (put s >> m)|.
Additional axioms will be introduced as needed to cover these properties.

%We will also require another property which we will only introduce informally
%here (and formulate more clearly later).
%In global state semantics, the right-distributivity rule does not hold in
%general. However, there are some cases where an operation does distribute over
%non-deterministic choice while preserving semantics; more precisely, this is the
%case when
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item the left branch of the choice operator does not modify the state,
%\item the operation that is distributed over the choice operator is idempotent
%  with respect to the state, and
%\item this operation is at the top-level of the program (i.e. it is not a
%  subterm of a larger term).
%\end{enumerate}
%This last property is a ``global'' property.
%In order to formulate it correctly, we first need to develop a notation that
%allows us to distinguish between local and global properties.
%We will do this in Section~\ref{sec:ctxt-trans}.

\subsection{Chaining Using Non-deterministic Choice}
\label{sec:chaining}

In backtracking algorithms that keep a global state, it is a common pattern to
1. update the current state to its next step,
2. recursively search for solutions, and
3. roll back the state to the previous step.
To implement such pattern as a monadic program, one might come up with something like the code below:
\begin{spec}
modify next >> search >>= modReturn prev {-"~~."-}
\end{spec}
where |next| advances the state, |prev| undoes the modification of |next|
(|prev . next = id|), and |modify| and |modReturn| are defined by:
\begin{spec}
modify f       = get >>= (put . f) {-"~~,"-}
modReturn f v  = modify f >> return v {-"~~."-}
\end{spec}
Let the initial state be |st| and assume that |search| found three choices |m1 `mplus` m2 `mplus` m3|. The intention is that all of |m1|, |m2|, and |m3| start running with state |next st|, and the state is restored to |prev (next st) = st| afterwards. By \eqref{eq:bind-mplus-dist}, however,
\begin{spec}
 modify next >> (m1 `mplus` m2 `mplus` m3) >>= modReturn prev =
   modify next >> (  (m1 >>= modReturn prev) `mplus`
                     (m2 >>= modReturn prev) `mplus`
                     (m3 >>= modReturn prev)) {-"~~,"-}
\end{spec}
which, with a global state, means that |m2| starts with state |st|, after which the state is rolled back too early to |prev st|. The computation |m3| starts with |prev st|, after which the state is rolled too far to |prev (prev st)|.

In fact, one cannot guarantee that |modReturn prev| is always executed --- if |search| fails, we get |modify next >> search >>= modReturn prev| |= modify next >> mzero >>= modReturn prev = modify next >> mzero|. Thus the state is advanced to |next st|, but not rolled back to |st|.

We need a way to say that ``|modify next| and |modReturn prev| are run exactly once, respectively before and after all non-deterministic branches in |solve|.'' Fortunately, we have discovered a curious technique. Define
\begin{spec}
side :: MNondet a => m a -> m b
side m = m >> mzero {-"~~."-}
\end{spec}
Since non-deterministic branches are executed sequentially, the program
\begin{spec}
side (modify next) `mplus` m1 `mplus` m2 `mplus` m3 `mplus` side (modify prev)
\end{spec}
executes |modify next| and |modify prev| once, respectively before and after all the non-deterministic branches, even if they fail.
Note that |side m| does not generate a result.
Its presence is merely for the side-effect of |m|, hence the name.
%Note also that the type of |side m| need not be the same as that of |m|.

The reader might wonder: now that we are using |(`mplus`)| as a sequencing operator, does it simply coincide with |(>>)|?
Recall that we still have left-distributivity \eqref{eq:bind-mplus-dist} and, therefore,
|(m1 `mplus` m2) >> n| equals |(m1 >> n) `mplus` (m2 >> n)|.
That is, |(`mplus`)| acts as ``insertion points'', where future code followed by |(>>)| can be inserted into!
This is certainly a dangerous feature, whose undisciplined use can lead to chaos.
However, we will exploit this feature and develop a safer programming pattern in the next section.

\subsection{State-Restoring Operations}
\label{subsec:state-restoring-ops}

The discussion above suggests that one can implement backtracking, in a global-state setting, by using |mplus| and |side| appropriately.
We can even go a bit further by defining the following variations of |put|,
which restores the original state when it is backtracked over:
\begin{spec}
putR :: {S s, N} `sse` eps => s -> Me eps ()
putR s = get >>= \s0 -> put s `mplus` side (put s0) {-"~~."-}
\end{spec}

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.7]{sections/putR}
  \caption{Illustration of state-restoring put}
  \label{fig:putR}
\end{figure}

%if False
\begin{code}
putR :: (MonadPlus m, MonadState s m) => s -> m ()
putR s = get >>= \s0 -> put s `mplus` side (put s0) {-"~~."-}
\end{code}
%endif

To help build understanding for |putR|,
Figure~\ref{fig:putR} shows the flow of execution for the expression
|(putR t >> ret x) `mplus` ret y|. Initially, the state is |s|; it gets
modified to |t| at the |put t| node after which the value |x| is output
with the working state |t|.
Then, we backtrack (since we're using global-state semantics, the state
modification caused by |put t| is not reversed), arriving at |put s|, which
resets the state to |s|, immediately fails, and backtracks to the right
branch of the topmost |mplus|. There the value |y| is output with working
state |s|.

For some further intuition about |putR|, consider |putR s >> comp| where |comp| is some arbitrary computation:
%if False
\begin{code}
putRExplain :: (MonadPlus m, MonadState s m) => s -> m b -> m b
putRExplain s comp =
\end{code}
%endif
\begin{code}
      putR s >> comp
 ===  (get >>= \s0 -> put s `mplus` side (put s0)) >> comp
 ===    {- monad law, left-distributivity \eqref{eq:bind-mplus-dist} -}
      get >>= \s0 -> (put s >> comp) `mplus` (side (put s0) >> comp)
 ===    {- by \eqref{eq:bind-mzero-zero}, |mzero >> comp = mzero| -}
      get >>= \s0 -> (put s >> comp) `mplus` side (put s0) {-"~~."-}
\end{code}
Thanks to left-distributivity \eqref{eq:bind-mplus-dist}, |(>> comp)| is promoted into |mplus|.
Furthermore, the |(>> comp)| after |side (put s0)| is discarded by
\eqref{eq:bind-mzero-zero}.
In words, |putR s >> comp| saves the current state, computes |comp| using state |s|, and restores the saved state!
The subscript |R| stands for ``restore.''
Note also that |(putR s >> m1) >> m2) = putR s >> (m1 >> m2)| --- the state restoration happens in the end.

The behaviour of |putR|, however, is still rather tricky. It is instructive comparing
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item |return x|,  \label{ex:putR-pitfalls-1}
\item |put s >> return x|, and \label{ex:putR-pitfalls-2}
\item |putR s >> return x|. \label{ex:putR-pitfalls-3}
\end{enumerate}
When run in initial state |s0|, they all yield |x| as the result.
The final states after running \ref{ex:putR-pitfalls-1}, \ref{ex:putR-pitfalls-2} and \ref{ex:putR-pitfalls-3} are |s0|, |s| and |s0|, respectively.
However, \ref{ex:putR-pitfalls-3} does {\em not} behave identically to \ref{ex:putR-pitfalls-1} in all contexts!
For example, in the context |(>> get)|, we can tell them apart:
|return x >> get| returns |s0|, while |putR s >> return x >> get| returns |s|, even though the program yields final state |s0|.

We wish that |putR|, when run with a global state, satisfies laws \eqref{eq:put-put} through \eqref{eq:mzero-bind-zero} ---
the state laws and the \emph{local} state laws.
If so, one could take a program written for a local state monad, replace all occurrences of |put| by |putR|, and run the program with a global state.
Unfortunately this is not the case: |putR| does satisfy |put|-|put|~\eqref{eq:put-put} and |put|-|get|~\eqref{eq:put-get}, but |get|-|put|~\eqref{eq:get-put} fails ---
|get >>= putR| and |return ()| can be
told apart by some contexts, for example |(>> put t)|.
To see that, we calculate:
\begin{spec}
   (get >>= putR) >> put t
=  (get >>= \s -> get >>= \s0 -> put s `mplus` side (put s0)) >> put t
=   {- |get|-|get| -}
   (get >>= \s -> put s `mplus` side (put s)) >> put t
=   {- monad laws, left-distributivity -}
   get >>= \s -> (put s >> put t) `mplus` side (put s)
=   {- |put|-|put| -}
   get >>= \s -> put t `mplus` side (put s) {-"~~."-}
\end{spec}
Meanwhile, |return () >> put t = put t|, which does not behave in the same way as |get >>= \s -> put t `mplus` side (put s)| when $s \neq t$.

In a global-state setting, the left-distributivity law \eqref{eq:bind-mplus-dist} makes it tricky to reason about combinations of |mplus| and |(>>=)| operators.
Suppose we have a program |(m `mplus` n)|, and we construct an extended program by binding a continuation |f| to it such that we get |(m `mplus` n) >>= f| (where |f| might modify the state).
Under global-state semantics, the evaluation of the right branch is influenced by the state modifications performed by evaluating the left branch.
So by \eqref{eq:bind-mplus-dist}, this means that when we get to evaluating the |n| subprogram in the extended program, it will do so with a different initial state (the one obtained after running |m >>= f|) compaired against the initial state in the original program (the one obtained by running |m|).
In other words, placing our program in a different context changed the meaning of one of its subprograms.
So it is difficult to reason about programs compositionally in this setting --- some properties hold only when we take the entire program into consideration.

It turns out that all properties we need do hold, provided that {\em all} occurrences of |put| are replaced by |putR| --- problematic contexts such as |put t| above are thus ruled out.
However, that ``all |put| are replaced by |putR|'' is a global property, and to properly talk about it we have to formally define contexts, which is what we will do in Section~\ref{sec:ctxt-trans}.
