\section{Non-Determinism with Global State}
\label{sec:nd-state-global}

For a monad with both non-determinism and state, the local state laws imply that each non-deterministic branch has its own state. This is not costly for states consisting of linked data structures, for example the state |(Int, [Int], [Int])| in the |n|-queens problem. In some applications, however, the state might be represented by data structures, e.g. arrays, that are costly to duplicate. For such practical concerns, it is worth considering the situation when all non-deterministic branches share one global state.

Non-deterministic monads with a global state, however, is rather tricky.
One might believe that |M a = s -> ([a],s)| is a natural implementation of such a monad.
The usual, naive implementation of |(>>=)| using this representation, however, does not satisfy left-distributivity \eqref{eq:bind-mplus-dist}, violates monad laws, and is therefore not even a monad.
%See Section \ref{sec:conclusion} for previous work on construction of a correct monad.
\footnote{
The type |ListT (State s)| generated using the now standard Monad Transformer Library~\cite{MTL:14} expands to essentially the same implementation, and is flawed in the same way.
More careful implementations of |ListT|, which does satisfy \eqref{eq:bind-mplus-dist} and the monad laws, have been proposed~\cite{Gale:07:ListT, Volkov:14:list-t}.
Effect handlers (e.g. Wu~\shortcite{Wu:14:Effect} and Kiselyov and Ishii~\shortcite{KiselyovIshii:15:Freer}) do produce correct implementations if we run the handler for non-determinism before that of state.
}

Even after we do have a non-deterministic, global-state passing implementation that is a monad, its semantics can sometimes be surprising.
In |m1 `mplus` m2|, the computation |m2| receives the state computed by |m1|.
Thus |mplus| is still associative, but certainly cannot be commutative.
As mentioned in Section \ref{sec:right-distr-local-state}, right-distributivity \eqref{eq:mplus-bind-dist} implies commutativity of |mplus|.
Contravariantly, \eqref{eq:mplus-bind-dist} cannot be true when the state is global.
Right-zero \eqref{eq:mzero-bind-zero} does not hold either: |mzero| simply fails, while |put s >> mzero|, for example, fails with an altered global state.
These significantly limit the properties we may have.

The aim of this section is to appeal to intuition and see what happens when we work with a global state monad:
what pitfall we may encounter, and what programming pattern we may use,
to motivate the more formal treatment in Section~\ref{sec:ctxt-trans}.

\subsection{The Global State Law}
\label{sec:laws-global-state}

We have already discussed general laws for nondeterministic monads
(laws~\eqref{eq:mplus-assoc} through~\eqref{eq:bind-mzero-zero}),
as well as laws which govern the interaction between state and nondeterminism in
a local state setting (laws~\eqref{eq:mplus-bind-dist} and
\eqref{eq:mzero-bind-zero}).
For global state semantics, an alternative law is required to govern the
interactions between nondeterminism and state.
We call this the \emph{global state law}, to be discussed in more detail in Section~\ref{sec:model-global-state-sem}.
\begin{alignat}{2}
&\mbox{\bf put-or}:\quad&
  |(put s >> m) `mplus` n| &=~ |put s >> (m `mplus` n)|~ \mbox{~~,}
    \label{eq:put-or}
\end{alignat}
This law allows the lifting of a |put| operation from the left
branch of a nondeterministic choice, an operation which does not preserve
meaning under local-state semantics:
suppose for example that |m = mzero|, then by
\eqref{eq:mzero-bind-zero} and~\eqref{eq:mzero-mplus}, the left-hand side of
the equation is equal to |n|, whereas by
~\eqref{eq:mzero-mplus},
the right-hand side of the equation is equal to |put s >> n|.

By itself, this law leaves us free to choose from a large space of semantic domain
implementations with different properties.
For example, in any given implementation, the programs |return x `mplus` return y| and
|return y `mplus` return x| may be considered semantically identical, or they may be
considered semantically distinct.
The same goes for the programs |return x `mplus` return x| and |return x|,
or the programs |(put s >> return x) `mplus` m| and
|(put s >> return x) `mplus` put s >> m|.
Additional axioms will be introduced as needed to cover these properties.

%We will also require another property which we will only introduce informally
%here (and formulate more clearly later).
%In global state semantics, the right-distributivity rule does not hold in
%general. However, there are some cases where an operation does distribute over
%non-deterministic choice while preserving semantics; more precisely, this is the
%case when
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item the left branch of the choice operator does not modify the state,
%\item the operation that is distributed over the choice operator is idempotent
%  with respect to the state, and
%\item this operation is at the top-level of the program (i.e. it is not a
%  subterm of a larger term).
%\end{enumerate}
%This last property is a ``global'' property.
%In order to formulate it correctly, we first need to develop a notation that
%allows us to distinguish between local and global properties.
%We will do this in Section~\ref{sec:ctxt-trans}.

\subsection{Chaining Using Non-deterministic Choice}
\label{sec:chaining}

In backtracking algorithms that keep a global state, it is a common pattern to
1. update the current state to its next step,
2. recursively search for solutions, and
3. roll back the state to the previous step.
To implement such pattern as a monadic program, one might come up with something like the code below:
\begin{spec}
modify next >> search >>= modReturn prev {-"~~."-}
\end{spec}
where |next| advances the state, |prev| undoes the modification of |next|
(|prev . next = id|), and |modify| and |modReturn| are defined by:
\begin{spec}
modify f       = get >>= (put . f) {-"~~,"-}
modReturn f v  = modify f >> return v {-"~~."-}
\end{spec}
Let the initial state be |st| and assume that |search| found three choices |m1 `mplus` m2 `mplus` m3|. The intention is that all of |m1|, |m2|, and |m3| start running with state |next st|, and the state is restored to |prev (next st) = st| afterwards. By \eqref{eq:bind-mplus-dist}, however,
\begin{spec}
 modify next >> (m1 `mplus` m2 `mplus` m3) >>= modReturn prev =
   modify next >> (  (m1 >>= modReturn prev) `mplus`
                     (m2 >>= modReturn prev) `mplus`
                     (m3 >>= modReturn prev)) {-"~~,"-}
\end{spec}
which, with a global state, means that |m2| starts with state |st|, after which the state is rolled back too early to |prev st|. The computation |m3| starts with |prev st|, after which the state is rolled too far to |prev (prev st)|.

In fact, one cannot guarantee that |modReturn prev| is always executed --- if |search| fails, we get |modify next >> search >>= modReturn prev| |= modify next >> mzero >>= modReturn prev = modify next >> mzero|. Thus the state is advanced to |next st|, but not rolled back to |st|.

We need a way to say that ``|modify next| and |modReturn prev| are run exactly once, respectively before and after all non-deterministic branches in |solve|.'' Fortunately, we have discovered a curious technique. Define
\begin{spec}
side :: N `mem` eps => Me eps a -> Me eps b
side m = m >> mzero {-"~~."-}
\end{spec}
%if False
\begin{code}
side :: MonadPlus m => m a -> m b
side m = m >> mzero {-"~~."-}
\end{code}
%endif
Since non-deterministic branches are executed sequentially, the program
\begin{spec}
side (modify next) `mplus` m1 `mplus` m2 `mplus` m3 `mplus` side (modify prev)
\end{spec}
executes |modify next| and |modify prev| once, respectively before and after all the non-deterministic branches, even if they fail.
Note that |side m| does not generate a result.
Its presence is merely for the side-effect of |m|, hence the name.
%Note also that the type of |side m| need not be the same as that of |m|.

The reader might wonder: now that we are using |(`mplus`)| as a sequencing operator, is it the same as |(>>)|? Recall that we still have
left-distributivity \eqref{eq:bind-mplus-dist} and, therefore,
|(m1 `mplus` m2) >> n| equals |(m1 >> n) `mplus` (m2 >> n)|.
That is, |(`mplus`)| acts as ``insertion points'', where future code connected by |(>>)| can be inserted into!
We will exploit this feature in the next section.

\subsection{State-Restoring Operations}
\label{subsec:state-restoring-ops}

The discussion above suggests that one can implement backtracking, in a global-state setting, by using |mplus| and |side| appropriately.
We can even go a bit further by defining the following variations of |put|,
which restores the original state when it is backtracked over:
\begin{spec}
putR :: {S s, N} `sse` eps => s -> Me eps ()
putR s = get >>= \s0 -> put s `mplus` side (put s0) {-"~~."-}
\end{spec}

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics{sections/putR}
  \caption{Illustration of state-restoring put}
  \label{fig:putR}
\end{figure}

%if False
\begin{code}
putR :: (MonadPlus m, MonadState s m) => s -> m ()
putR s = get >>= \s0 -> put s `mplus` side (put s0) {-"~~."-}
\end{code}
%endif

To help build understanding for |putR|,
Figure~\ref{fig:putR} shows the flow of execution for the expression
|(putR t >> ret x) `mplus` ret y|. Initially, the state is |s|; it gets
modified to |t| at the |put t| node after which the value |x| is output
with the working state |t|.
Then, we backtrack (since we're using global-state semantics, the state
modification caused by |put t| is not reversed), arriving at |put s|, which
resets the state to |s|, immediately fails, and backtracks to the right
branch of the topmost |mplus|. There the value |y| is output with working
state |s|.

For some further intuition about |putR|, consider |putR s >> comp| where |comp| is some arbitrary computation:
%if False
\begin{code}
putRExplain :: (MonadPlus m, MonadState s m) => s -> m b -> m b
putRExplain s comp =
\end{code}
%endif
\begin{code}
      putR s >> comp
 ===  (get >>= \s0 -> put s `mplus` side (put s0)) >> comp
 ===    {- monad law, left-distributivity \eqref{eq:bind-mplus-dist} -}
      get >>= \s0 -> (put s >> comp) `mplus` (side (put s0) >> comp)
 ===    {- by \eqref{eq:bind-mzero-zero}, |mzero >> comp = mzero| -}
      get >>= \s0 -> (put s >> comp) `mplus` side (put s0) {-"~~."-}
\end{code}
Thanks to left-distributivity \eqref{eq:bind-mplus-dist}, |(>> comp)| is promoted into |mplus|.
Furthermore, the |(>> comp)| after |side (put s0)| is discarded by
\eqref{eq:bind-mzero-zero}.
In words, |putR s >> comp| saves the current state, computes |comp| using state |s|, and restores the saved state!
The subscript |R| stands for ``restore.''

The behaviour of |putR|, however, is still rather tricky. It is instructive comparing
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item |return x|,  \label{ex:putR-pitfalls-1}
\item |put s >> return x|, and \label{ex:putR-pitfalls-2}
\item |putR s >> return x|. \label{ex:putR-pitfalls-3}
\end{enumerate}
When run in initial state |s0|, they all yield |x| as the result.
The final states after running \ref{ex:putR-pitfalls-1}, \ref{ex:putR-pitfalls-2} and \ref{ex:putR-pitfalls-3} are |s0|, |s| and |s0|, respectively.
However, \ref{ex:putR-pitfalls-3} does {\em not} behave identically to \ref{ex:putR-pitfalls-1} in all contexts!
For example, in the context |(>> get)|, we can tell them apart:
|return x >> get| returns |s0|, while |putR s >> return x >> get| returns |s|, even though the program yields final state |s0|.

We wish that |putR|, when run with a global state, satisfies laws \eqref{eq:put-put} through \eqref{eq:mzero-bind-zero} ---
the state laws and the \emph{local} state laws.
If so, one could take a program written for a local state monad, replace all occurrences of |put| by |putR|, and run the program with a global state.
Unfortunately this is not the case: |putR| does satisfy |put|-|put|~\eqref{eq:put-put} and |put|-|get|~\eqref{eq:put-get}, but |get|-|put|~\eqref{eq:get-put} fails ---
|get >>= putR| and |return ()| can be
told apart by some contexts, for example |(>> put t)|.
To see that, we calculate:
\begin{spec}
   (get >>= putR) >> put t
=  (get >>= \s -> get >>= \s0 -> put s `mplus` side (put s0)) >> put t
=   {- |get|-|get| -}
   (get >>= \s -> put s `mplus` side (put s)) >> put t
=   {- monad laws, left-distributivity -}
   get >>= \s -> (put s >> put t) `mplus` side (put s)
=   {- |put|-|put| -}
   get >>= \s -> put t `mplus` side (put s) {-"~~."-}
\end{spec}
Meanwhile, |return () >> put t = put t|, which does not behave in the same way as |get >>= \s -> put t `mplus` side (put s)| when $s \neq t$.

In a global-state setting, the left-distributivity law \eqref{eq:bind-mplus-dist} makes it tricky to reason about combinations of |mplus| and |(>>=)| operators.
Suppose we have a program |(m `mplus` n)|, and we construct an extended program by binding a continuation |f| to it such that we get |(m `mplus` n) >>= f| (where |f| might modify the state).
Under global-state semantics, the evaluation of the right branch is influenced by the state modifications performed by evaluating the left branch.
So by \eqref{eq:bind-mplus-dist}, this means that when we get to evaluating the |n| subprogram in the extended program, it will do so with a different initial state (the one obtained after running |m >>= f|) compaired against the initial state in the original program (the one obtained by running |m|).
In other words, placing our program in a different context changed the meaning of one of its subprograms.
So it is difficult to reason about programs compositionally in this setting --- some properties hold only when we take the entire program into consideration.

It turns out that all properties we need do hold, provided that {\em all} occurrences of |put| are replaced by |putR| --- problematic contexts such as |put t| above are thus ruled out.
However, that ``all |put| are replaced by |putR|'' is a global property, and to properly talk about it we have to formally define contexts, which is what we will do in Section~\ref{sec:ctxt-trans}.

\section{Laws and Translation for Global State Monad}
\label{sec:ctxt-trans}

In this section we give a more formal treatment of non-deterministic global state monad.
We propose laws such a monad should satisfy --- to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose these laws.
The laws turn out to be rather intricate.
To make sure that there exists a model, an implementation is proposed in the appendix, and it is verified in Coq that the laws and some additional theorems are satisfied.

The ultimate goal, however, is to show the following property:
given a program written for a local-state monad,
if we replace all occurrences of |put| by |putR|, the resulting
program yields the same result when run with a global-state monad.
This allows us to painlessly port our previous algorithm to work
with a global state.
To show this we first introduce a syntax for nondeterministic and stateful
monadic programs and contexts.
Then we imbue these programs with global-state semantics.
Finally we define the function that performs the translation just described, and prove that this translation is correct.

\caption{(a) Syntax for programs. (b) Environments and open programs. (c) Syntax
  for contexts. (d) Semantic domain.}
\label{fig:context-semantics}
\end{figure}
In the previous sections we have been mixing syntax and semantics,
which we avoid in this section by defining the program syntax as a free monad.
This way we avoid the need for a type-level distinction between programs
with local-state semantics and programs with global-state semantics.
Figure~\ref{fig:context-semantics}(a) defines a syntax for
nondeterministic, stateful, closed programs |Prog|, where
the |Get| and |Put| constructors take continuations as arguments, and
the |(>>=)| operator is defined as follows:
\begin{samepage}
\begin{spec}
  (>>=) :: Prog a -> (a -> Prog b) -> Prog b
  Return x       >>= f = f x
  mzero          >>= f = mzero
  (m `mplus` n)  >>= f = (m >>= f) `mplus` (n >>= f)
  Get k          >>= f = Get (\s -> k s >>= f)
  Put s m        >>= f = Put s (m >>= k) {-"~~."-}
\end{spec}
\end{samepage}%
One can see that |(>>=)| is defined as a purely syntactical manipulation, and
its definition has laws \eqref{eq:bind-mplus-dist} and
\eqref{eq:bind-mzero-zero} built-in.

The meaning of such a monadic program is determined by a semantic domain of our
choosing, which we denote with |Dom|, and its corresponding
domain operators |retD|, |failD|, |getD|, |putD| and |(<||||>)|
(see figure~\ref{fig:context-semantics}(d)).
The |run :: Prog a -> Dom a| function ``runs'' a program |Prog a| into a value
in the semantic domain |Dom a|:
\begin{samepage}
\begin{spec}
run (Return x)       = retD x
run mzero            = failD
run (m1 `mplus` m2)  = run m1 <||> run m2
run (Get k)          = getD (\s -> run (k s))
run (Put s m)        = putD s (run m) {-"~~."-}
\end{spec}
\end{samepage}%
Note that no |<>>=>| operator is required to define |run|;
in other words, |Dom| need not be a monad.
In fact, as we will see later, we will choose our implementation in such a way
that there does not exist a bind operator for |run|.

\subsection{Modeling Global State Semantics}
\label{sec:model-global-state-sem}
We impose the laws upon |Dom| and the domain operators to ensure the semantics of a
non-backtracking (global-state),
nondeterministic, stateful computation for our programs.
Naturally, we need laws analogous to the state laws and nondeterminism laws to
hold for our semantic domain.
As it is not required that a bind operator
(|(>>=) :: Dom a -> (a -> Dom b) -> Dom b|) can be defined for the semantic
domain (and we will later argue that it \emph{cannot} be defined for the domain,
given the laws we impose on it), the state laws
(\eqref{eq:put-put} through \eqref{eq:get-get})
must be reformulated to fit the continuation-passing style of the semantic domain
operators.
\begin{align}
  |putD s (putD t p)| &= |putD t p| \mbox{~~,} \label{eq:put-put-g-d} \\
  |putD s (getD k)| &= |putD s (k s)| \mbox{~~,} \label{eq:put-get-g-d} \\
  |getD (\s -> putD s m)| &= |m| \mbox{~~,} \label{eq:get-put-g-d} \\
  |getD (\s -> getD (\t -> k s t))| &= |getD (\s -> k s s)| \mbox{~~.} \label{eq:get-get-g-d}
\end{align}
As for the nondeterminism laws
(\eqref{eq:mplus-assoc}, \eqref{eq:mzero-mplus}, \eqref{eq:bind-mplus-dist},
\eqref{eq:bind-mzero-zero}),
we can simply omit the ones that mention at the semantic level |(>>=)|
as these are proven at the syntactic level: their proof follows immediately
from |Prog|'s definition of |(>>=)|.
\begin{align}
  &|(m <||||> n) <||||> p| = |m <||||> (n <||||> p)| \mbox{~~,} \\
  &|failD <||||> m| = |m <||||> failD| = |m| \mbox{~~.}
\end{align}

We also reformulate the global-state law~\eqref{eq:put-or}:
\begin{align}
|putD s p <||||> q|        &= |putD s (p <||||> q)| \mbox{~~.}\label{eq:put-or-g-d}
\end{align}
%In Section~\ref{sec:laws-global-state} we also mentioned that a law should exist
%which mandates a limited form of right-distribitivity which only holds on a
%global level.
%The continuation-passing style of our semantic domain operators allows us to
%express a weaker version of this global property (which suffices for our goals)
%as follows:
It turns out that, apart from the {\bf put-or} law,
our proofs require certain additional properties regarding commutativity and
distributivity which we introduce here:
\begin{align}
\begin{split}
|getD (\s -> putD (t s) p <||||> putD (u s) q <||||> putD s failD)| = \\
~~~~~~|getD (\s -> putD (u s) q <||||> putD (t s) p <||||> putD s failD)| \mbox {~~,}
\end{split} \label{eq:put-or-comm-g-d} \\
& |putD s (retD x <||||> p)| = |putD s (retD x) <||||> putD s p| \mbox{~~.}\label{eq:put-ret-or-g-d}
\end{align}
These laws are not considered general ``global state'' laws, because it is
possible to define reasonable implementations of global state semantics that
violate these laws, and because they are not exclusive to global state
semantics.

The |<||||>| operator is not, in general, commutative in a global state setting.
However, we will require that the order in which results are computed does not
matter.
Furthermore we require that the implementation is agnostic with repect to the
order of |putD| operations as long as the exact same results are computed with
the exact same state at the time of their computation.
These properties are enforced by law~\eqref{eq:put-or-comm-g-d}.
Implementations that present the results as an ordered list violate this law,
as are implementations that record the order of proper state changes.

In global-state semantics, |putD| operations cannot, in general,
distribute over |<||||>|.
However, an implementation may permit distributivity if certain conditions are
met.
Law~\eqref{eq:put-ret-or-g-d} states that a |putD| operation distributes over a
nondeterministic choice if the left branch of that choice simply returns a
value.
An example of an implementation that violates this law would be one that
applies a given function |f :: s -> s| to the state after each return.
Such an implementation would conform to an alternative law
|putD x (retD w <||||> q) = putD x (retD w) <||||> putD (f x) q|.
Law~\eqref{eq:put-ret-or-g-d} only holds if the implementation of |Dom| does not
permit the definition
of a bind operator |(<>>=>) :: Dom a -> (a -> Dom b) -> Dom b|.
Consider for instance the following program:
\begin{code}
  putD x (retD w <||> getD retD) <>>=> \z -> putD y (retD z) {-"~~."-}
\end{code}
If \eqref{eq:put-ret-or-g-d} holds, this program should be equal to

However, Figure~\ref{fig:put-ret-or-vs-bind} proves that the first program can
be reduced to |putD y (retD w <||||> retD y)|,
whereas the second program is equal to
|putD y (retD w <||||> retD x)|,
which clearly does not always have the same result.

It is worth remarking that, even if we don't impose law~\eqref{eq:put-or-comm-g-d},
this requirement disqualifies the most
straightforward candidate for the semantic domain, |ListT (State s)|, as a
bind operator can be defined for it.

In Appendix~\ref{sec:GSMonad} we present an implementation of |Dom| and its
operators that satisfies all the laws in this section, for which we provide
\emph{machine-verified proofs}, and which does not permit
the implementation of a sensible bind operator.

\subsection{Contextual Equivalence}
\label{subsec:contextual-equivalence}
With our semantic domain sufficiently specified, we can prove analogous
properties for programs interpreted through this domain.
We must take care in how we reformulate these properties however.
It is certainly not sufficient to merely copy the laws as formulated for the
semantic domain, substituting |Prog| data constructors for semantic domain
operators as needed; we must keep in mind that a term in |Prog a| describes a
syntactical structure without ascribing meaning to it.
For example, one cannot simply assert that |Put x (Put y p)| is \emph{equal} to
|Put y p|, because although these two programs have the same semantics, they
are not structurally identical.
It is clear that we must define a notion of ``semantical equivalence'' between
programs.
We can map the syntactical structures in |Prog a| onto the semantic domain
|Dom a| using |run| to achieve that.
Yet wrapping both sides of an equation in |run| applications
is not enough as such statements only apply at the top-level of a program.
For instance, while |run (Put x (Put y p)) = run (Put y p)| is a correct statement,
we cannot prove
|run (Return w `mplus` Put x (Put y p)) = run (Return w `mplus` Put y p)|
from such a law.

So the concept of semantical equivalence in itself is not sufficient; we require
a notion of ``contextual semantic equivalence'' of programs which allows us to
formulate properties about semantical equivalence which hold in any surrounding
context.
Figure~\ref{fig:context-semantics}(c) provides the definition for single-hole
contexts |Ctx|.
A context |C| of type |Ctx e1 a e2 b| can be interpreted as a function that, given a
program that returns a value of type |a| under environment |e1| (in other words:
the type and environment of the hole), produces a program that returns a value
of type |b| under environment |e2| (the type and environment of the whole program).
Filling the hole with |p| is denoted by |apply C p|.
The type of environments, |Env| is defined using heterogeneous lists
(Figure~\ref{fig:context-semantics}(b)).
When we consider the notion of programs in contexts, we must take into account
that these contexts may introduce variables which are referenced by the program.
The |Prog| datatype however represents only closed programs.
Figure~\ref{fig:context-semantics}(b) introduces the |OProg| type to represent
``open'' programs, and the |Env| type to represent environments.
|OProg e a| is defined as the type of functions that construct a \emph{closed}
program of type |Prog a|, given an environment of type |Env e|.
Environments, in turn, are defined as heterogeneous lists.
We also define a function for mapping open programs onto the semantic domain.
\begin{spec}
  orun :: OProg e a -> Env e -> Dom a
  orun p env = run (p env) {-"~~."-}
\end{spec}

We can then assert that two programs are contextually equivalent if, for
\emph{any} context, running both programs wrapped in that context will
yield the same result:
\newcommand{\CEq}{=_\mathtt{GS}}
\begin{align*}
  |m1| \CEq |m2| \triangleq \forall C. |orun (apply C m1)| = |orun (apply C m2)| \mbox{~~.}
\end{align*}

We can then straightforwardly formulate variants of the state laws, the
nondeterminism laws and the |put|-|or| law for this global state monad as
lemmas. For example, we reformulate law~\eqref{eq:put-put-g-d} as
\begin{align*}
  |Put s (Put t p)| &\CEq |Put t p| \mbox{~~.}
\end{align*}
Proofs for the state laws, the nondeterminism laws and the |put|-|or| law then
easily follow from the analogous semantic domain laws. The formulation of a
|put|-|ret|-|or| law-like property \eqref{eq:put-ret-or-g-d} requires somewhat
more care: because there exists a bind operator for |Prog|, we must stipulate
that it does not hold in arbitrary contexts:
\begin{align}
|run (Put s (Return x `mplus` p))| = |run (Put s (Return x) `mplus` Put s p)| \label{eq:put-ret-or-g} \mbox{~~.} \checkmark
\end{align}
The proof of this statement has been machine-verified in Coq.
We annotate theorems which have been verified in Coq with a $\checkmark$.

\subsection{Simulating Local-State Semantics}

We simulate local-state semantics by replacing each occurrence of |Put| by a
variant that restores the state, as described in Section~\ref{subsec:state-restoring-ops}. This transformation is implemented by the
function |trans| for closed programs, and |otrans| for open programs:
\begin{samepage}
\begin{spec}
  trans   :: Prog a -> Prog a
  trans (Return x)     = Return x
  trans (p `mplus` q)  = trans p `mplus` trans q
  trans mzero          = mzero
  trans (Get p)        = Get (\s -> trans (p s))
  trans (Put s p)      = Get (\s' -> Put s (trans p) `mplus` Put s' mzero) {-"~~,"-}

  otrans  :: OProg e a -> OProg e a
  otrans p             = \env -> trans (p env) {-"~~."-}
\end{spec}
\end{samepage}%
We then define the function |eval|, which runs a transformed program (in other
words, it runs a program with local-state semantics).
\begin{spec}
eval :: Prog a -> Dom a
eval = run . trans {-"~~."-}
\end{spec}
We show that the transformation works by proving that our free monad equipped
with |eval| is a correct
implementation for a nondeterministic, stateful monad with local-state semantics.
We introduce notation for ``contextual equivalence under simulated backtracking
semantics'':
\newcommand{\CEqLS}{=_\mathtt{LS}}
\begin{align*}
  |m1| \CEqLS |m2| \triangleq \forall C. |eval (apply C m1)| = |eval (apply C m2)| \mbox{~~.}
\end{align*}
For example, we formulate the statement that the |put|-|put|
law~\eqref{eq:put-put-g-d} holds for our monad as interpreted by |eval| as
\begin{align*}
  |Put s (Put t p)| &\CEqLS |Put t p| \mbox{~~.} \checkmark
\end{align*}
Proofs for the nondeterminism laws follow trivially from the nondeterminism laws
for global state.
The state laws are proven by promoting |trans| inside, then applying
global-state laws.
For the proof of the |get|-|put| law, we require the property that in
global-state semantics, |Put| distributes over |(`mplus`)| if the left branch
has been transformed (in which case the left branch leaves the state unmodified).
This property only holds at the top-level.
\begin{align}
  % put_or_trans
|run (Put x (trans m1 `mplus` m2))| = |run (Put x (trans m1) `mplus` Put x m2)| \label{eq:put-ret-mplus-g}\mbox{~~.} \checkmark
\end{align}
Proof of this lemma depends on law~\eqref{eq:put-ret-or-g-d}.

Finally, we arrive at the core of our proof:
to show that the interaction of state and nondeterminism in this
implementation produces backtracking semantics.
To this end we prove laws analogous to the local state laws
\eqref{eq:mplus-bind-dist} and \eqref{eq:mzero-bind-zero}
\begin{align}
  |m >> mzero|                      &\CEqLS |mzero| \mbox{~~,} \label{eq:mplus-bind-zero-l} \checkmark \\
  |m >>= (\x -> f1 x `mplus` f2 x)| &\CEqLS |(m >>= f1) `mplus` (m >>= f2)| \mbox{~~.} \checkmark \label{eq:mplus-bind-dist-l}
\end{align}
We provide machine-verified proofs for these theorems.

The proof for~\eqref{eq:mplus-bind-zero-l} follows by straightforward induction.

The inductive proof (with induction on |m|) of law~\eqref{eq:mplus-bind-dist-l}
requires some additional lemmas.

For the case |m = m1 `mplus` m2|, we require the property that, at the top-level
of a global-state program, |mplus| is commutative if both its operands are
state-restoring.
Formally:
\begin{align}
  |run (trans p `mplus` trans q)| = |run (trans q `mplus` trans p)|\mbox{~~.} \checkmark
\end{align}
The proof of this property motivated the introduction of
law~\eqref{eq:put-or-comm-g-d}.

The proof for both the |m = Get k| and |m = Put s m'| cases requires that |Get|
distributes
over |mplus| at the top-level of a global-state program if the left branch is
state restoring.
\begin{align}
  % get_or_trans
|run (Get (\s -> trans (m1 s) `mplus` (m2 s)))| = |run (Get (\s -> trans (m1 s)) `mplus` Get m2)| \label{eq:get-ret-mplus-g}\mbox{~~.} \checkmark
\end{align}

And finally, we require that the |trans| function is, semantically speaking,
idempotent, to prove the case |m = Put s m'|.
\begin{align}
  % get_or_trans
|run (trans (trans p)) = run (trans p)| \label{eq:run-trans-trans} \mbox{~~.} \checkmark
\end{align}

\noindent

\subsection{Backtracking with a Global State Monad}
There is still one technical detail to to deal with before we deliver a backtracking algorithm that uses a global state.
As mentioned in Section~\ref{sec:chaining}, rather than using |put|, such algorithms typically use a pair of commands |modify prev| and |modify next|, with |prev . next = id|, to update and restore the state.
This is especially true when the state is implemented using an array or other data structure that is usually not overwritten in its entirety.
Following a style similar to |putR|, this can be modelled by:
\begin{spec}
  modifyR :: {N, S s} `sse` eps -> (s -> s) -> (s -> s) -> Me eps ()
  modifyR next prev = modify next `mplus` side (modify prev) {-"~~."-}
\end{spec}

Is it always safe to replace |get >>= (\s -> put (next s) >> m)| by
|modify_R next prev >> m|?
We can explore this question by extending our |Prog| syntax with an additional
|Modify_R| construct, thus obtaining a new |Prog_m| syntax:
\begin{spec}
data Prog_m a where
  Modify_R  :: (S -> S) -> (S -> S) -> Prog_m a -> Prog_m a
\end{spec}

We assume that |prev . next = id| for every |Modify_R next prev p| in a |Prog_m a| program.

We can then define two translation functions from |Prog_m a| to |Prog a|,
which both also replace |Put|s with |putR|s along the way, like the regular
|trans| function.
The first replaces each |Modify_R| in the program by a direct analogue of the
definition given above, while the second replaces it by
|Get (\s -> Put (next s) (trans_2 p))|:

\begin{spec}
   trans_1 :: Prog_m a -> Prog a
   ...
   trans_1 (Modify_R next prev p)  =
     Get (\s -> Put (next s) (trans_1 p) `mplus` Get (\t -> Put (prev t) mzero))


   trans_2 :: Prog_m a -> Prog a
   ...
   trans_2 (Modify_R next prev p)  =
     Get (\s -> Put (next s) (trans_2 p))
\end{spec}

Proving that it is safe to replace each occurrence of
|get >>= (\s -> put (next s) >> m)| by a
|modify_R| then boils down to proving that these two translation functions from
|Prog_m|s to |Prog|s always yield semantically identical programs:
\begin{lemma}
  |run (trans_1 (apply c p)) = run (trans_2 (apply c p))| \mbox{~~.}
\end{lemma}
Strictly speaking we also need a new definition of contexts and
context application for the |Prog_m| datatype; we omitted this here for brevity.

%\begin{align*}
%  |eval (apply C (Get (\s -> Put (next s) m)))|
%  =
%  |run (apply (transC C) (modifyR next prev (trans m)))| \mbox{~~.}
%\end{align*}


%\begin{spec}
%modifyR :: {N, S s} `sse` eps -> (s -> s) -> (s -> s) -> Me eps ()
%modifyR next prev = modify next `mplus` side (modify prev) {-"~~."-}
%\end{spec}
%%if False
%\begin{code}
%modifyR :: (MonadPlus m, MonadState s m) => (s -> s) -> (s -> s) -> m ()
%modifyR next prev =  modify next `mplus` side (modify prev) {-"~~,"-}
%\end{code}
%%endif
%One can see that |modifyR next prev >> m| expands to
%|(modify next >> m) `mplus` side (modify prev)|, thus the two |modify|s are performed before and after |m|.
%
%Assume that |s0| is the current state.
%Is it safe to replace |putR (next s0) >> m| by |modifyR next prev >> m|?
%We can do so if we are sure that |m| always restores the state to |s0| before |modify prev| is performed.
%We say that a monadic program |m| is {\em state-restoring} if, for all |comp|, the initial state in which |m >>= comp| is run is always restored when the computation finishes. Formally, it can be written as:
%\begin{definition} |m :: {N, S s} `sse` eps => Me eps a| is called {\em state-restoring} if
%  |m = get >>= \s0 -> m `mplus` side (put s0)|.
%\end{definition}
%Certainly, |putR s| is state-restoring. In fact, the following properties allow state-restoring programs to be built compositionally:
%\begin{lemma} We have that
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item |mzero| is state-restoring,
%\item |putR s| is state-restoring,
%\item |guard p >> m| is state-restoring if |m| is,
%\item |get >>= f| is state-restoring if |f x| is state-storing for all |x|, and
%\item |m >>= f| is state restoring if |m| is state-restoring.
%\end{enumerate}
%\end{lemma}
%\noindent Proof of these properties are routine exercises.
%With these properties, we also have that, for a program |m| written using our program syntax, |trans m| is always state-restoring.
%The following lemma then allows us to replace certain |putR| by |modifyR|:
%\begin{lemma} Let |next| and |prev| be such that |prev . next = id|.
%If |m| is state-restoring, we have
%%if False
%\begin{code}
%putRSRModifyR ::
%  (MonadPlus m, MonadState s m) => (s -> s) -> (s -> s) -> m b -> m b
%putRSRModifyR next prev m =
%\end{code}
%\begin{code}
%  get >>= \s -> putR (next s) >> m {-"~~"-}=== {-"~~"-}
%    modifyR next prev >> m {-"~~."-}
%\end{code}
%%endif
%\begin{equation*}
%  |get >>= \s -> putR (next s) >> m| ~=~
%    |modifyR next prev >> m| \mbox{~~.}
%\end{equation*}
%\end{lemma}

\paragraph{Backtracking using a global-state monad}
Recall that, in Section~\ref{sec:solve-n-queens},
we showed that a problem formulated by |unfoldM p f z >>= assert (all ok . scanlp oplus st)| can be solved by a hylomorphism |solve p f ok oplus st z|,
run in a non-deterministic local-state monad.
Putting all the information in this section together,
we conclude that solutions of the same problem can be computed,
in a non-deterministic global-state monad,
by |run (solveR p f ok oplus ominus st z)|, where |(`ominus` x) . (`oplus` x) = id| for all |x|, and |solveR| is defined by:
\begin{spec}
solveR :: {N, S s} `sse` eps =>  (b -> Bool) -> (b -> Me eps (a, b)) ->
                                 (s -> Bool) -> (s -> a -> s) -> (s -> a -> s) -> s -> b -> Me eps [a]
solveR p f ok oplus ominus st z = putR st >> hyloM odot (return []) p f z
  where x `odot` m =  (get >>= guard . ok . (`oplus` x)) >>
                      modifyR (`oplus` x) (`ominus` x) >> ((x:) <$> m) {-"~~."-}
\end{spec}
Note that the use of |run| enforces that the program is run as a whole, that is, it cannot be further composed with other monadic programs.



\paragraph{|n|-Queens using a global state}
To wrap up, we revisit the |n|-queens puzzle.
Recall that, for the puzzle, |(i,us,ds) `oplus` x = (1 + i,  (i+x):us,  (i-x):ds)|.
By defining |(i,us,ds) `ominus` x  = (i - 1, tail us, tail ds)|,
we have |(`ominus` x) . (`oplus` x) = id|.
One may thus compute all solutions to the puzzle,
in a scenario with a shared global state, by |run (queensR n)|,
where |queens| expands to:
\begin{spec}
queensR n = put (0,[],[]) >> queensBody [0..n-1] {-"~~,"-}

queensBody []  =  return []
queensBody xs  =  select xs >>= \(x,ys) ->
                  (get >>= (guard . ok . (`oplus` x))) >>
                  modifyR (`oplus` x) (`ominus` x) >> ((x:) <$> queensBody ys) {-"~~,"-}
  where  (i,us,ds) `oplus` x   = (1 + i,  (i+x):us,  (i-x):ds)
         (i,us,ds) `ominus` x  = (i - 1,  tail us,   tail ds)
         ok (_,u:us,d:ds) = (u `notElem` us) && (d `notElem` ds) {-"~~."-}
\end{spec}

% They all show the sequential nature of |mplus| in this setting: in \eqref{eq:side-side}, adjacent |side| commands can be combined; in \eqref{eq:put-mplus} and \eqref{eq:get-mplus}, state operators bound before |mplus| branches can be bound to the leftmost branch, and in \eqref{eq:put-ret-side}, the effect of |put s >> return x| can be moved to the next branch. Finally, \eqref{eq:side-nd-mplus} allows side effects to commute with branches that only returns non-deterministic results.

% The following laws regarding |putR| are true:
% \begin{align*}
%     |putR s >>= get| ~&=~ |putR s >>= return s| \mbox{~~,} \\
%     |putR s >> putR s'| ~&=~ |putR s'|  \mbox{~~.}
% \end{align*}
% \end{lemma}
%
% \begin{lemma}\label{lma:putR-nd-commute}
% |putR| commutes with non-determinism. That is, |m >>= \x -> putR s >> return x = putR s >> m| for |m :: Me N a|.
% \end{lemma}
%
% Proof of Lemma \ref{lma:putR-basics} is a routine exercise. Lemma \ref{lma:putR-nd-commute} can be proved by induction on the syntax of |m|, using properties including \eqref{eq:side-side}, \eqref{eq:put-ret-side}, \eqref{eq:side-nd-mplus}, and \eqref{eq:get-mplus-side-distr}.
%
% % \begin{proof}
% % We present the proof for the |putR|-|putR| law for illustrative purpose. The proof demonstrates the use of \eqref{eq:put-mplus} and \eqref{eq:side-put-put}.
% % \begin{spec}
% %    putR s >> putR s'
% % =  (get >>= \s0 -> (put s `mplus` side (put s0))) >>
% %    (get >>= \s0 -> (put s' `mplus` side (put s0)))
% % =    {- left-distributivity \eqref{eq:bind-mplus-dist} -}
% %    get >>= \s0 -> (put s >> get >>= \s0 -> (put s' `mplus` side (put s0))) `mplus` side (put s0)
% % =    {- |put|-|get| \eqref{eq:get-put} -}
% %    get >>= \s0 -> (put s >> (put s' `mplus` side (put s))) `mplus` side (put s0)
% % =    {- by \eqref{eq:put-mplus} -}
% %    get >>= \s0 -> (put s >> puts') `mplus` side (put s) `mplus` side (put s0)
% % =    {- |put|-|put| \eqref{eq:put-put} and \eqref{eq:side-put-put} -}
% %    get >>= \s0 -> put s' `mplus` side (put s0)
% % =  putR s' {-"~~."-}
% % \end{spec}
% % \end{proof}
% Note that we do not have a |get|-|putR| law: |get >>= putR| does not equal |return ()|. To see that, observe that |(get >>= putR) >> put t| terminates with the initial state, while |return () >> put t| terminates with state |t|.
%
% \paragraph{State-Restoration, Compositionally} Pushing the idea a bit further, we say that a monadic program |m| is {\em state-restoring} if, for all |comp|, the initial state in which |m >>= comp| is run is always restored when the computation finishes. Formally, it can be written as:
% \begin{definition} |m :: {N, S s} `sse` eps => Me eps a| is called {\em state-restoring} if
%   |m = get >>= \s0 -> m `mplus` side (put s0)|.
% \end{definition}
% Certainly, |putR s| is state-restoring. In fact, state-restoring programs can be built compositionally, using the following properties:
% \begin{lemma} We have that
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item |mzero| is state-restoring,
% \item |putR s| is state-restoring,
% \item |guard p >> m| is state-restoring if |m| is,
% \item |get >>= f| is state-restoring if |f x| is state-storing for all |x|, and
% \item |m >>= f| is state restoring if |m| is state-restoring.
% \end{enumerate}
% \end{lemma}
% Proof of these properties are routine exercises.
%
% \paragraph{Incremental Updating and Restoration}
% Identifying state-restoring programs helps to discover when we can update and restore the state in an incremental manner.
% When the state |s| is a big structure, such as an array, it might not be feasible to perform |put s| that rewrites an entire array.
% Instead one might use another command |modify f| that applies the function |f| to the state. It can be characterised by:
% \begin{spec}
%   modify f = get >>= \s -> put (f s) {-"~~,"-}
% \end{spec}
% but one may assume that, for commands such as |modify (\arr -> arr // [(i,x)])| (where |(// [(i,x)])| updates the |i|-th entry of the array to |x|), there exists a quicker implementation that mutates the array rather than creating a new array.
%
% Given a function |next :: s -> s| that alters the state, and |prev :: s -> s| that is the inverse of |next|, we define the following state-restoring variation of |modify|:
% \begin{spec}
% modifyR :: {N, S s} `sse` eps -> (s -> s) -> (s -> s) -> Me eps ()
% modifyR next prev =  modify next `mplus` side (modify prev) {-"~~,"-}
% \end{spec}
% %if False
% \begin{code}
% modifyR :: (MonadPlus m, MonadState s m) => (s -> s) -> (s -> s) -> m ()
% modifyR next prev =  modify next `mplus` side (modify prev) {-"~~,"-}
% \end{code}
% %endif
% such that |modifyR next prev >> comp| performs |modify next| before computation in |comp|, and |modify prev| afterwards. We have that:
% \begin{lemma} Let |next| and |prev| be such that |prev . next = id|.
% If |m| is state-restoring, we have
% %if False
% \begin{code}
% putRSRModifyR ::
%   (MonadPlus m, MonadState s m) => (s -> s) -> (s -> s) -> m b -> m b
% putRSRModifyR next prev m =
% \end{code}
% %endif
% \begin{code}
%   get >>= \s -> putR (next s) >> m {-"~~"-}=== {-"~~"-}
%     modifyR next prev >> m {-"~~."-}
% \end{code}
% \end{lemma}
% We look at its proof, which demonstrates the use of \eqref{eq:side-side} -- \eqref{eq:get-mplus}, monad laws, and laws regarding |get| and |put|.
% For the rest of this paper we use the following abbreviations:
% \begin{code}
% sidePut st  = side (put st)    {-"~~,"-}
% sideMod f   = side (modify f)  {-"~~."-}
% \end{code}
% \begin{proof} We calculate:
% %if False
% \begin{code}
% putRSRModifyRDer1 ::
%   (MonadPlus m, MonadState s m) => (s -> s) -> (s -> s) -> m b -> m b
% putRSRModifyRDer1 next prev m =
% \end{code}
% %endif
% \begin{code}
%       modifyR next prev >> m
%  ===    {- definiton of |modifyR|, |modify|, and left-distributivity \eqref{eq:bind-mplus-dist} -}
%       (get >>= \s -> put (next s) >> m) `mplus` sideMod prev
%  ===    {- by \eqref{eq:get-mplus} -}
%       get >>= \s -> (put (next s) >> m) `mplus` sideMod prev {-"~~."-}
% \end{code}
% We focus on the part within |(get >>= \s -> _)|:
% %if False
% \begin{code}
% putRSRModifyRDer2 ::
%   (MonadPlus m, MonadState s m) =>
%   (s -> s) -> (s -> s) -> s -> m a -> m a
% putRSRModifyRDer2 next prev s m =
% \end{code}
% %endif
% \begin{code}
%       (put (next s) >> m) `mplus` sideMod prev
%  ===    {- |m| state-restoring -}
%       (put (next s) >> get >>= \s' -> m `mplus` sidePut s') `mplus` sideMod prev
%  ===    {- |put|-|get| \eqref{eq:get-put} -}
%       (put (next s) >> (m `mplus` sidePut (next s))) `mplus` sideMod prev
%  ===    {- by \eqref{eq:put-mplus} -}
%       put (next s) >> (m `mplus` sidePut (next s) `mplus` sideMod prev)
%  ===    {- by \eqref{eq:side-side}, and |prev . next = id| -}
%       put (next s) >> (m `mplus` sidePut s)
%  ===    {- by \eqref{eq:put-mplus} -}
%       (put (next s) >> m) `mplus` sidePut s {-"~~."-}
% \end{code}
% Put it back to the context |(get >>= \s -> _)|, and the expression simplifies to |get >>= \s -> putR (next s) >> m|.
